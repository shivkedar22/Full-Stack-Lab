Over the years, the market has seen an uptick in the use of innovative, sustainable, and safety-compliant packaging solutions designed to preserve the quality and nutritional value of baby foods. The global market for baby food packaging is being driven by factors such as the growing working population, the rise in disposable incomes, and an increased focus on product safety and hygiene standards. Additionally, the growing trend of organic and natural baby food products is contributing to the adoption of eco-friendly packaging solutions, which further boosts market expansion.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>In terms of packaging types, flexible packaging, such as pouches and sachets, has become the most popular choice due to its lightweight, cost-effective, and user-friendly attributes.
